I'm a statistician with a keen interest on computational applied research in fields as varied as biology, chemistry or physics. I obtained my PhD in Oct. 2019 at UPF, under the supervision of Prof. Gianni de Fabritiis. The main topic of my thesis was applied machine learning research at several early stages of the drug discovery process.

As of Nov. 2019 I joined ETH Zurich as a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Prof. Gisbert Schneider and within the RETHINK design initiative. My current research interests include explainable artificial intelligence, drug design, structural biology and Bayesian statistics.

### A bit more personal

I was born and grew up in the beautiful city of Seville, Spain, where I also pursued my BSc in Statistics at the University of Seville. I then worked as an intern at IMC with the intent of providing statistical technical support in social and demographic studies. I then moved to Barcelona to pursue my MSc in Statistics and Operations Research at UPC, where I also developed an interest for bioinformatics.

Besides research, my hobbies include playing the electric guitar, playing beach volley (not so much ever since I moved to Switzerland), brewing my own beer and cycling.
