I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge interested in applications at the interface between cheminformatics and statistical learning. Prior to joining MSR, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Gisbert Schneider’s molecular design laboratory at ETH Zurich while funded by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, where I became interested in explainable artificial intelligence methods in the context of drug design and chemical property prediction. I obtained my PhD in 2019 at Gianni de Fabritiis’ biophysics laboratory at Pompeu Fabra University, the main topic of my dissertation including pioneering applications of convolutional neural networks to three-dimensional atomistic systems.
 

## Project details 

At MSR I am focusing on expanding our understanding of explainable artificial intelligence models in drug discovery as well as their applicability in real-life scenarios. Other research areas that I am interested in are quantum mechanics and structural biology.

### About me 

I was born and grew up in the beautiful city of [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville), Spain, where I also pursued my BSc in Statistics at the [University of Seville](http://www.us.es/). I then worked as an intern at [IMC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/instituto-de-marketing-y-comunicaci-n-imc-/about/) with the intent of providing statistical technical support in social and demographic studies. I then moved to Barcelona to pursue my MSc in Statistics and Operations Research at [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en), where I also developed an interest for bioinformatics.

My hobbies include beach volleyball, guitar playing and hiking.
