I'm a statistician with a keen interest on computational applied research in fields as varied as biology, chemistry or physics. I obtained my PhD in Oct. 2019 at [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/es/), under the supervision of [Prof. Gianni de Fabritiis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-_kX4kMAAAAJ&hl=en), the main topic of my thesis being applied machine learning research at several early stages of the drug discovery process.

As of Nov. 2019 I joined [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) as a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Gisbert Schneider](https://cadd.ethz.ch/) and within the [RETHINK](https://blogs.ethz.ch/RETHINK/) design initiative. My current research interests include explainable artificial intelligence, drug design, structural biology and Bayesian statistics.

### A bit more personal

I was born and grew up in the beautiful city of [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville), Spain, where I also pursued my BSc in Statistics at the [University of Seville](http://www.us.es/). I then worked as an intern at [IMC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/instituto-de-marketing-y-comunicaci-n-imc-/about/) with the intent of providing statistical technical support in social and demographic studies. I then moved to Barcelona to pursue my MSc in Statistics and Operations Research at [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en), where I also developed an interest for bioinformatics.

Besides research, my hobbies include playing the electric guitar, playing beach volley (not so much ever since I moved to Switzerland), brewing my own beer and cycling.
